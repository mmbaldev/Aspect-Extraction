"Looks even better in person. Be careful to not drop your phone so often because the rhinestones will fall off (duh). More of a decorative case than it is protective, but I will say that it fits perfectly and securely on my phone. Overall, very pleased with this purchase.",rhinestones,case
When you don't want to spend a whole lot of cash but want a great deal...this is the shop to buy from!
"so the case came on time, i love the design. I'm actually missing 2 studs but nothing too noticeable the studding is almost a bit sloppy around the bow, but once again not too noticeable. I haven't put in my phone yet so this is just what I've notice so far",design,studding,bow
DON'T CARE FOR IT.  GAVE IT AS A GIFT AND THEY WERE OKAY WITH IT.  JUST NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.
"I liked it because it was cute, but the studs fall off easily and to protect a phone this would not be recommended. Buy if you just like it for looks.",studs
The product looked exactly like the picture and it was very nice. However only days later it fell apart. I'm very disappointed with the quality of the product.,quality
I FINALLY got my case today. It took forever to get here! It's cute and looks just like the pic. Like right after I wrote this review some of the rhinestones started falling off. The package does come with glue to glue them back on but in my opinion this case is only good for a couple of days (if that.) I wouldn't purchase another. Thanks you,case
"It is a very cute case. None of the jewels have fallen off and the bow is glued on very well. Came in the time frame that was given and I'm happy with this purchase. The only thing you might want to know is, I carry my phone in my jeans and it does fit very tightly because it is a big bow. You have to be careful but worth it.",case,bow,fit
DO NOT BUY! this item is seriously cheap as heck. not worth buying it at all. I didn't even get to use it and it was already losing all of its gems. I wish I got my money back on this item!!

its super cute and makes my phone pretting and i love sparkley things and yeah hahahahahahh i would say get it
Another great product that my daughter she use it for a long time but now she has the iPhone 5c. Transaction went well and fast.
Very cheap broke the first time we put it on :( It was pretty but very cheaply made!! Too bad as it is cute
I purchased this for my grand-daughters phone. She loves it and it is so unique. The quality of the cover is very good.,quality of the cover
Beautiful quality and outstanding product! Everyone compliments me on the case and thinks I spent wayy wayy more than I really did :),quality,case
It is such a good case for a low price. I have it on right now and never had any problems with it besides losing about 2 stones since my purchase because I'm rough with it. I recommend it.,price

I have used this case for a couple weeks & so far its been great!  All the little blings have stayed in place.  Very sparkly & cute.,case
The bow fell off multiple times I had to keep gluing it back on until it wouldn't let me glue anymore. of course studs fell off but the bow it what makes it.,bow

"Bought this for my mom, it's just as it appears, very cute. It is definitely a bulky case, but if you're thinking about buying a case with a big bow on the back you can't expect it to be small. It did take longer than average to arrive, but it came in perfect condition.",case,bow on the back
Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.

"For the price i received a pretty great case! I received many compliments on how cute it was! the bow on the back looked like it might fall out but i have had it for 6 months and nope, its strongly attached! the diamonds in the back amazed me how long they stayed attached and only like 3 have fallen off, not too bad. it fits nicely on my phone. but i don't recommend dropping your phone because it doesn't give you protection from impacts! its more like a ""look at my pretty phone"" kind of case. Unfortunately i had to replace my case because due to my crazy lifestyle (throwing my phone in bags and pockets) the plastic by the volume buttons started to break off. But i will definitely buy another one to put on my iPhone on special occasions only!",price,case,bow on the back,plastic by the volume buttons

I love this case and it looks so pretty on the phone.  I just feel like its going to break if i drop it! I dropped it once and one of those diamonds came off.  The bow is a little loose as well.  It also provides NO protection for the phone at all!! This is simply just for show.,case,bow

It actually took a very long time and I contacted them and they gave me a full refund but I still got it anyway for free :))) Since the second I put it on I get compliments all day and its gorgeous on my white phone. I did paint it with clear and all the diamonds are still there except some constantly fall off the ribbon.

"love it!!!!!
its gorgeous
arrived on time i get many compliments on it
its definitely a girly case which i love"
I love this case. I have plenty of cases but this is 1 of my favs.. I kept this case on longer than any case I have. Sum of the stones fall off but they give u extra. Once I ran out of extras I changed da case.... Lol,case
I love the product but unfortunately the diamonds started falling off after only a week of having it. If you get it plan to only use it once in a while not for everyday use
"The case is pretty and looks closely to the one pictured.  Instead of the bow being on a slant or angle, it is straight across the back.  When I took it out of the package, a couple of crystals already fell off before I put it on the phone.  No biggie, I can glue more or buy more if necessary.  The bow has something pink on the side, I'm not sure if it's excess non-clear glue or perhaps some paint.  Either way, it's a pretty case.",case,bow,bow
Defintiely worth the price...You should order several.  Most cases are $15 and up especially at the cell phone stores.  I can't believe the mark up on these things!,price

It is quite pretty though.",paint,case,sealant,3D effect
"Beautiful case.  No complaints at all...other than the day I got it, my husband gave me an Evo 3D!  That's okay.  This case will be my step-daughters Christmas present.",case

Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!

I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly. Since this one still works, I have the other two to fall back on when this one finally goes out.

"Could not power my S2 phone.  The LG charger I was using had no problem but I needed a second charger.  I thought buying an ""Official Samsung"" charger would be the best route to go.

On a long trip I was forced to turn the phone completely off for a few hours to get it to charge.

"First, this is kind of cheap-looking, but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone, so that's forgiveable.  The springs on the side don't have much force, though, so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port.  The cable is sturdy, but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff, which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle.  It's held up well since I purchased it though.

I like this charger because I don't have to pull in and out of the socket in the car.  When I plug the phone in ut turns on.  When I unplug it goes off.  Saves the wear and tear of the car socket.,charger

Plugged into the car and worked the first couple of days. Hasn't worked since. My phone does not even recognize it's plugged in.
thank you. it did not disappoint. was as expected and does the job though I am going to a new phone as the galaxy 2 has been acting up consistently. shutting down by surprise etc...
"This thing worked well when it actually functioned, but today it stopped working and I am past the 30 day return window by 10 days give or take.

I'm guessing the quality might not be great as that is why it stopped working, who knows.. What a waste of money.",quality
This car charger works great for my Sprint Samsung Galaxy SII Epic 4G touch phone.  Good price and shipped promptly.,price,shipped
